# Bronchovascular Bundle Modelling

## 1. Introduction
This repository contains the source code for the pipeline to generate a model of a bronchovascular bundle from the CT imaging.


## 2. Installation
For simple installation and runtime, we use `poetry` to orchestrate installation of most of the dependencies. To run the pipeline, we recommend using Python version 3.8 or higher. Then, navigate to the root directory of the repository and run:
`./initial_setup.sh`
The repository should initialize the working environment to run the scripts. As a initial step before running scripts, activate the virtual environment by running:

For Linus/MacOS:
`source .venv/bin/activate`

For Windows users:
`.venv/Scripts/activate`

# 3. Usage
For generating a bronchovascular model object, run:
